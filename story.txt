Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Sreethan Reddy[1],

I am writing to you from a Best Friend[2] spaceship in a handsome [3] galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a Blue[4] rocket in March[5]. There are 27[6] Bikes and Baskets of Apples here! In the
Bedroom there is a pool full of Water. I fall asleep each night on a Comfortable bed of foam and dream of playing happily. It feels as though I have lived here for a 100 Years. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
Hoping on a Giant Rocket!!

Best wishes,
C-3PO
